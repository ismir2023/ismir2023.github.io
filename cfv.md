We are excited to announce the ISMIR 2023 Volunteering program!

ISMIR 2023 will be held in a hybrid format and will be hosted in Milan, Italy. Given the hybrid format of the event, we are looking for volunteers who can be present physically at the venue in Milan and who can help remotely leading up to the conference. As ISMIR is a globally accessible conference, we welcome volunteers from all around the world. The main tasks are supporting the organization team on ground and managing the virtual conference. Typical tasks will include helping out physical participants during the conference, helping the session chairs during the hybrid sessions, quality checking the presentation videos, helping with ISMIR proceedings, managing the virtual platform during the conference, troubleshooting, etc. We are looking for passionate individuals who are interested in volunteering their time and skills to make a difference in our community.
ISMIR is a unique community where music, people, and technologies meet. As a volunteer, you can have an opportunity to join the community and get to know like-minded people. Also, your contribution is essential to build a thriving research community.
The volunteers will help to support the 24-hour schedule over the 5 days of the conference, from November 5th 2023 to November 9th 2023, as well as provide support during days before it. Each volunteer will cover three 4-hour shifts.
If you are interested in volunteering for ISMIR 2023, please be patient. We will open the submission form in mid May 2023.
In the meantime, if you would like have more information, please do not hesitate to contact us.
We look forward to hearing from you and working together to make a positive impact in our community.
Thank you in advance for your contributions and interest to ISMIR 2023!
