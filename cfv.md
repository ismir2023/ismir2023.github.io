We are looking for volunteers for ISMIR 2023, which will be held in a hybrid format and will be hosted in Milan, Italy, from November 5 to November 9. Given the hybrid format of the event, we are looking for volunteers who can be present physically at the venue in Milan and who can help remotely leading up to the conference. As ISMIR is a globally accessible conference, we welcome volunteers from all around the world. The main tasks are supporting the organization team on ground and managing the virtual conference. Typical tasks will include helping out physical participants during the conference, helping the session chairs during the hybrid sessions, quality checking the presentation videos, managing the virtual platform during the conference, troubleshooting, etc. Anyone is eligible for the position as long as you are willing and available to support this conference.

We need your help before and during the conference (primarily between October 16 and November 3, 2023). If you are interested in volunteering for ISMIR 2023, **please fill out the form below by August 25**. We will allocate the best task and dates for you based on your availability and timezone. We will also make sure that volunteers can enjoy the conference as participants by asking them for only a reasonable amount of time. In particular, each volunteer will cover three 4-hour shifts, both for remote and on-site tasks.
**Link to the form:** [https://forms.office.com/e/JjWib4Fs5P](https://forms.office.com/e/JjWib4Fs5P)

To show our appreciation for your support, volunteers will be featured on our organization [team webpage](https://ismir2023.ismir.net/team) with a photo and short bio, and get free access to the conference.

ISMIR is a unique community where music, people, and technologies meet. As a volunteer, you can have an opportunity to join the community and get to know like-minded people. Also, your contribution is essential to build a thriving research community.

We look forward to hearing from you and working together to make a positive impact in our community. Thank you in advance for your contributions and interest to ISMIR 2023!
