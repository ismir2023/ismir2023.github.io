# Christine Bauer

### <ins>Bio</ins>
Christine Bauer is EXDIGIT Professor of Interactive Intelligent Systems at the Department of Artificial Intelligence and Human Interfaces (AIHI) at the Paris Lodron University Salzburg, Austria.

Her research centers on interactive intelligent systems, where she integrates research on intelligent technologies, the interaction of humans with an intelligent system, and their interplay. She takes a human-centered perspective, where technology follows humans' and society's needs. In recent years, she worked on context-aware recommender systems in the music and media domains. The core interests in her research activities are fairness and multi-method evaluations.

She has authored more than 100 papers and holds several best paper awards and many awards for her reviewing activities. She received the prestigious Elise Richter career research grant (2017–2020), funded by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF). She is on the Editorial Board of ACM Transactions on Recommender Systems (TORS) and co-organizes the Workshop series "Perspectives on the Evaluation of Recommender Systems (PERSPECTIVES)”.

She advocates for equal opportunities and engages in initiatives such as Women in Music Information Retrieval (WiMIR) and the Allyship program at CHI.

### Title: Building & Launching MIR systems at industry scale
### Abstract: 
There is a considerable gap in the research and engineering methods we use to build MIR systems for academic research and the way we build them for industry-scale systems. This keynote covers some of the many differences and challenges faced when building MIR systems for industry applications. We first discuss the way we define problems in the first place, and why the academic definition of problems is often ill-suited for a particular application. There are also substantial differences in engineering workflows – in particular when multiple researchers and engineers build a single system. We explore differences in academic datasets which are usually "small and clean" to real-world datasets which are "large and noisy". Academic metrics are useful for us scientists, but they often either don't match a product use case or mean nothing to product teams. Finally, we dig into deployment considerations including how to run inference flexibly, considering cost and speed, and where the system needs to run. We will explore numerous real-world examples throughout and provide insight into how to build MIR systems within industry.

# Joey Stuckey

### <ins>Bio</ins>

Joey Stuckey is the Official Music Ambassador of his hometown of Macon, Georgia. Joey spends every moment living life to the fullest and sharing his story and inspirational spirit through his musical performances and speaking engagements. As a toddler, Joey was diagnosed with a brain tumor and underwent surgery with little hope of survival. Though the tumor left Joey blind and with other health challenges, today, he continues to live a successful life of intention in his chosen field of music. Joey is professor of music technology at Mercer University, the music technology consultant for Middle Georgia State University, and an official music mentor for the Recording, Radio and Film Connection in Los Angeles as well as an active voting member of the Grammys. He is the owner and senior engineer at Shadow Sound Studio which is a destination recording facility with state-of-the-art analog and digital technology.  He has spoken and performed all over the world including at the University College of London, the Georgia Music Hall of Fame, and the Audio Engineering Society in New York City, just to name a few. In his roles as producer, engineer, recording artist and journalist, he has worked with many musical legends including Trisha Yearwood, Clarence Carter, James Brown, Alan Parsons, Gene Simmons (KISS), Al Chez (Tower of Power), Jimmy Hall (Wet Willie), Danny Seraphin (Chicago), Kevin Kenney (Drivin’ and Cryin’), and many, many more.
