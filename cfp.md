summary: The Call for Papers of the 24th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference
---

ISMIR 2023 welcomes contributions in all the areas related to MIR and its applications, including music computational analysis, processing, generation, algorithms, and their evaluation. ISMIR is a truly interdisciplinary community, which fosters collaboration between researchers, developers, educators, librarians, students, and professionals from the disciplines involved in Music Information Retrieval, such as musicology, cognitive science, library and information science, computer science, electrical engineering, and many others. ISMIR 2023 will foster the discussion and exchange of ideas among the attendees, with special attention to new topics, emerging problems, inclusion and diversity.

# Topics of interest

Relevant topics for ISMIR 2023 include, but are not limited to:
- MIR fundamentals and methodology
- Knowledge-driven approaches to MIR
- Musical features and properties
- MIR tasks
- Evaluation, datasets, and reproducibility
- Philosophical and ethical discussions
- Human-centered MIR
- Computational musicology
- Applications

Beyond the topics of interest listed above, a special focus will be placed on the applications of machine learning in musical acoustics. In recent years, the study of the acoustics of musical instruments has undergone a revolution, due to the adoption of the machine learning paradigm in this field. MIR researchers are in the forefront for the cutting-edge use of machine learning. We would like ISMIR 23 to become a meeting point for encouraging cross-dissemination between MIR and musical acoustics research areas. 

# Selection process
Full paper review: Each paper will be reviewed by at least three reviewers and a program committee member (meta-reviewer) who will oversee the process and write a meta-review with a recommendation. The Scientific Program Chairs will make the final decision based on that recommendation.
Double blind review: ISMIR follows a double-blind review process. Authors should not know the names of the reviewers of their papers, and reviewers should not know the name(s) of the author(s).

Evaluation criteria: Evaluation criteria include scholarly/scientific quality, novelty of the paper, reusable insights, novelty, readability and paper organization, potential to generate discourse, and relevance of the topic to ISMIR. Papers which propose brave new ideas are valued. It is helpful to read the [reviewer guidelines](https://ismir.net/reviewer-guidelines) before paper submission.

# Online attendance

The conference will be organized in hybrid modality. Papers are expected to be delivered in person for quality of experience. The ISMIR community, however, is very sensitive to issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion; and the ISMIR board and Organizing Committee are willing and ready to help presenters with specific needs (e.g. visa problems, parental leave, health or financial issues, etc.). We therefore encourage presenters with such needs to reach out to the [general chairs](ismir2023@ismir.net) and the [program chairs](ismir2023-papers@ismir.net) and discuss exceptions to the in-presence rule or possibility of financial support.
