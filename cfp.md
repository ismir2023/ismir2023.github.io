# Online attendance

The conference will be organized in hybrid modality. Papers are expected to be delivered in person for quality of experience. The ISMIR community, however, is very sensitive to issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion; and the ISMIR board and Organizing Committee are willing and ready to help presenters with specific needs (e.g. visa problems, parental leave, health or financial issues, etc.). We therefore encourage presenters with such needs to reach out to the [general chairs](mailto:ismir2023@ismir.net) and the [program chairs](mailto:ismir2023-papers@ismir.net) and discuss exceptions to the in-presence rule or possibility of financial support.
