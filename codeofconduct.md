## ISMIR 2023 CODE OF CONDUCT

ISMIR 2023 is committed to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. All attendees, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers at our conference are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

### The Quick Version

Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. Participants are expected to engage in constructive, respectful, and inclusive conversations, and harassment of conference participants in any form will not be tolerated. Participants are expected to respect the privacy protocols of the conference. This Code of Conduct applies to all ISMIR 2023 activities including both physical and virtual events comprising talks, poster sessions, tutorials, workshops, social events, Twitter, and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.


### The Less Quick Version

#### Harassment

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, technology choices, posting of inappropriate sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact and unwelcome sexual attention. Other forms of harassment for the virtual format of ISMIR 2023 include disrupting the virtual meeting (e.g., “zoom-bombing”), engaging in harm or threats of harm of any kind, and creating/contributing to a safety threat or unsafe or exclusionary situation.
Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Sponsors should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.
Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.
If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately.
Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.
We expect participants to follow these rules at ISMIR 2023 conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.

### Privacy Protocols: Screencaptures, Audio and Video recordings

Given the hybrid nature of the conference, most of the scientific sessions of ISMIR 2023 events will be livestreamed and also recorded. Participants will be alerted in the program and at events. The audio and video recordings of such sessions made available to registered conference participants are only for their viewing and cannot be shared further without the express consent of conference organizers and participants involved in the recordings.
Providing access to the virtual conference platform or sharing Zoom meeting links with people who have not registered for the conference without the express consent of the conference organizers is prohibited.
Do not take audio or video recordings of any ISMIR 2023 activities unless explicit permission has been granted by all participants.
Do not take or share screenshots of participants or presenters without explicit permission from everyone present or making sure that participants cannot be identified.
Do not share audio or video recordings of ISMIR 2023 besides those released by the conference (via social media or any other means) unless these have been posted with permission by all participants.
Do not take or distribute pictures of or copy research posters/presentation materials unless explicitly allowed by the license terms under which these materials are distributed. All ISMIR 2023 presentation videos, posters, and papers are freely available on the conference site.
Chat logs can be saved for personal use only.

### Consequences/Enforcement

If a participant engages in harassing or inappropriate behaviour, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference venue and virtual platforms with no refund.
Participants asked to stop any harassing or inappropriate behaviour are expected to comply immediately.
