ISMIR 2023 will be accompanied by several satellite events around the conference.

# Workshop on Reading Music Systems (WoRMS) 
## November, 4th, 2023

The Workshop on Reading Music Systems (WoRMS) is an event that tries to connect researchers who develop systems for reading music, such as in the field of Optical Music Recognition, with other researchers and practitioners that could benefit from such systems, like librarians or musicologists. WoRMS provides an excellent opportunity to share ideas, discuss current developments and shape the future of Optical Music Recognition. The workshop is open for everything that is related to music, that has been written. The relevant topics of interest for the workshop include, but are not limited to:

- Music reading systems
- Optical music recognition
- Datasets and performance evaluation
- Image processing on music scores
- Writer identification
- Authoring, editing, storing and presentation systems for music scores
- Multi-modal systems
- Novel input-methods to produce written music
- Web-based Music Information Retrieval services
- Applications and projects
- Use-cases related to written music

IMPORTANT DATES

- Deadline for submission: 22nd September 2023
- Notification of acceptance: 20th October 2023
- Camera-ready: 27th October 2023
- Workshop: 4th November 2023

# 10th International Conference on Digital Libraries for Musicology (DLfM)
## November, 10th, 2023

CALL FOR PAPERS AND POSTERS
DLfM welcomes contributions related to any aspect of digital libraries and musicology, including topics related to musical archiving and retrieval, cataloguing and classification, musical databases, special collections, music encodings and representations, computational musicology, or music information retrieval (MIR).

Given DLfM’s return this year as a satellite event of the ISMIR conference, we welcome papers that apply MIR technologies to “music documents” with a focus on cultural heritage preservation. Scores and music documents have been digitized by libraries and archives worldwide for preservation and access. Some of these digital libraries' resources are being converted into symbolic files representing the music content of the documents. These symbolic music files, in turn, allow for more interaction with the music—through rendering, playback, search, and computational music analysis. At this DLfM congress, we aim to stimulate discussions around the use of MIR technologies in symbolic music and their implications for cultural heritage preservation.

The organizing committee strongly encourages papers and posters that address the theme, however, we welcome all papers addressing all traditional topics that fall under the scope of DLfM. Specific examples of topics traditionally covered at DLfM can be found below.

Proceedings of the DLfM 2023 are expected to be published in ACM ICPS as an Open Access publication as in previous years. Like last year, we are planning to be able to offer authors an open access proceedings paper without passing on the cost to authors.

IMPORTANT DATES (AoE)
- Paper (full paper and short paper) submission deadline: Friday, June 30, 2023
- Notification of paper acceptance: Friday, September 01, 2023
- Poster submission deadline: Friday, September 08, 2023
- Camera-ready submission deadline (full and short papers): Friday, September 29, 2023
- Conference registration deadline: TBA
- Conference: Friday, November 10, 2023, at Biblioteca del Conservatorio di Milano
