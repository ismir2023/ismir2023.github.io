# 10th International Conference on Digital Libraries for Musicology (DLfM)
## November, 10th, 2023

CALL FOR PAPERS AND POSTERS
DLfM welcomes contributions related to any aspect of digital libraries and musicology, including topics related to musical archiving and retrieval, cataloguing and classification, musical databases, special collections, music encodings and representations, computational musicology, or music information retrieval (MIR).

Given DLfM’s return this year as a satellite event of the ISMIR conference, we welcome papers that apply MIR technologies to “music documents” with a focus on cultural heritage preservation. Scores and music documents have been digitized by libraries and archives worldwide for preservation and access. Some of these digital libraries' resources are being converted into symbolic files representing the music content of the documents. These symbolic music files, in turn, allow for more interaction with the music—through rendering, playback, search, and computational music analysis. At this DLfM congress, we aim to stimulate discussions around the use of MIR technologies in symbolic music and their implications for cultural heritage preservation.

The organizing committee strongly encourages papers and posters that address the theme, however, we welcome all papers addressing all traditional topics that fall under the scope of DLfM. Specific examples of topics traditionally covered at DLfM can be found below.

Proceedings of the DLfM 2023 are expected to be published in ACM ICPS as an Open Access publication as in previous years. Like last year, we are planning to be able to offer authors an open access proceedings paper without passing on the cost to authors.
