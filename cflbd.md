# Call for Late-Breaking Demo


LBD session is a forum for sharing prototype systems, initial concepts, and early results which have not yet fully matured but are of interest to the Music-IR community. It is also a great entry point for people who are new to ISMIR to showcase their preliminary work and receive early feedback from fellow researchers.

Those interested should follow the submission guidelines (see below) and submit extended abstracts through the system. The accepted abstracts must be presented by at least one author as a poster during the LBD session. LBD session is "open", i.e. the participants do not have to pay for registering to the LBD. However, in order to keep track to whom who will be presenting, a registration is needed. Note that the LBD abstract is not a conference paper and will not be part of the official ISMIR 2023 proceedings.

Due to organizational constraints we limit the submissions to 15 in-presence presenters and 5 remote presenters. 

Submissions will be accepted on a first-come first-served basis. The organizing committee reserves the possibility of rejecting papers that fall below the standards of ISMIR, poorly formatted or lack relevance to the conference.
