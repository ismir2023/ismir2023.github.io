# Visit to the Violin Museum
On November 10 we are pleased to invite you for a visit to the Violin Museum in Cremona and a recital with a historical violin in the fascinating "Giovanni Arvedi" auditorium, purposely designed for the violin acoustics.

## Cremona
Cremona is a city in Northern Italy, located on the left bank of the Po river. 
The first historical clear evidences of Cremona date back to 400 BC. With the Romans the territory developed as a military outpost, and wuickly developed as an important city along the "Via Postumia", running from west to east north Italy, and linking Genoa with Aquileia. 
The city has undergone positive and negative periods through the centuries, but it is in the medieval age that Cremona experienced one of the most effulgent period. The Cathedral and Torrazzo (the third highest brickwork in Europe) date nack to that time.
Nowadays Cremona economy relies on the agricultural and food transformation.
