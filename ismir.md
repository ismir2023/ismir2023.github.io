The 24th conference of the International Society for Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) will be held in Milan, Italy, from November 5-9, 2023. ISMIR is the largest research venue for scholars, researchers, practitioners, and industries in the field of Music Information Retrieval (MIR), an interdisciplinary research area for the processing, analysis, indexing, organizing and accessing music-related data. ISMIR 2023 will be held in a hybrid format. The program will include submitted research papers and keynote talks by scholars in MIR and related areas. Special sessions will be organized to share thoughts and ideas on open problems in MIR. Satellite events will take place in the days following the conference, to promote discussion and collaboration between researchers working on MIR and related areas.

More details to come.
