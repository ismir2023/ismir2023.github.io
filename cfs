It is our great pleasure to announce the Call for Sponsors for the 24th International Society for Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) Conference, which will be held in Milan, Italy, from November 5-9, 2023.

ISMIR is the largest research venue for scholars, researchers and practitioners in the field of Music Information Retrieval (MIR), an interdisciplinary research area that aims to develop computational tools for processing, analysis, indexing, organizing and accessing music-related data. 

ISMIR 2023 offers sponsorship opportunities at the Platinum, Gold, and Silver levels, as described below.
