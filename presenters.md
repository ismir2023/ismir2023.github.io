# Instructions for Presenters

## Presentation Format

This year's ISMIR will take place in person.  In exceptional cases, presenters who cannot join the conference in Milan will be given the opportunity to interact with remote and in presence participants in a synchronous way during the conference.

**All papers will have both a short (4 minute) oral presentation, and a poster presentation. During the poster session, remote and in presence participants can interact with remote presenters through dedicated Zoom meetings.**

**Before the conference:**

*All* presenting authors are asked to upload* the following materials by **October 13th, 2023 AOE:**

- A pre-recorded video presenting of their paper (see instructions below)
- A poster presentation pdf (see instructions below)
- [Physical presentations only] The slides for the physical presentation (see instructions below).
- An image that best represents your paper, to be used as a thumbnail for the papers page on the online platform.

These materials will be available to all participants throughout the conference via the online platform (MiniConf).

*See the “Uploading Materials” section below for details.


**During the conference:**

Similar to ISMIR 2018, 2019 and 2022, paper sessions will have a single-track 4-minute oral presentation component, followed by a poster session for further questions and discussions.

**Oral presentation sessions:**

- In-person presenters will give their 4-minute presentation live during the session
- Remote presenters will have their pre-recorded video played back during the live session, alternating with in-person presentations.
- In-person attendees will watch this like a regular oral session
- Virtual attendees will be able to watch the full session via a Zoom or post-hoc as a recorded session available on the conference platform.
- For all participants, the 4-minute pre-recorded videos will be available on MiniConf throughout the conference.


**Poster sessions:**

- In-person presenters will be asked to print and present a physical poster like in normal conferences. A Slack channel for each paper will be used to asynchronously respond to questions. We strongly encourage video responses!
- Remote presenters will have a synchronous poster session by connecting via Zoom to a dedicated meeting .They will be able also  to respond to questions asynchronously via the paper’s dedicated Slack channel.
- Remote attendees will have access to all online poster pdfs via MiniConf, and will be able to asynchronously ask questions on the paper’s slack channel.

## Instructions for preparing materials

**Video Presentations**

Similar to the 4 minute presentations of past ISMIRs, these prerecorded short videos should introduce the topic of your paper, inform of some insights from the work, and entice watchers to read the paper and visit your poster sessions.

We recommend recording voice overs to a slide show or slides with embedded video of the presenter. One way to do this is record the presentation on a virtual meeting platform such as [Zoom](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362473-Enabling-and-starting-local-recordings), [Google Meet](https://support.google.com/meet/answer/9308681?hl=en), [Microsoft Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/record-a-meeting-in-teams-34dfbe7f-b07d-4a27-b4c6-de62f1348c24?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us). Presentation programs such as [Powerpoint](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/record-a-slide-show-with-narration-and-slide-timings-0b9502c6-5f6c-40ae-b1e7-e47d8741161c?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us) and screen capture programs such as [Screencast-o-matic](https://screencast-o-matic.com/) can be used to record slide presentations with voiceover.
