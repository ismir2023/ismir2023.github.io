# Travel

If you're planning on attending an event or visiting Politecnico di Milano, here are some travel options to consider.

## Travel Options
## Train
Taking the train to Milan is a great way to travel. Milan has excellent rail connections with the rest of Europe, and there are several high-speed trains that operate to and from Milan. From the main train station in Milan, Milano Centrale, you can take the subway (Line 2, green line) to reach Politecnico di Milano.
Apart from booking specific trains from A to B, you can also consider the option of a Interrail/Eurail pass. This gives great flexibility: you can use almost any train in Europe and most do not even need booking in advance.
There are now a range of options available. For example, there's a "4 days within one month pass" currently selling for under 200EUR. Those 4 days mean you can get to Milan from anywhere in Europe (max 2 days there, 2 days back).
 
Full pass options are listed here:
 
[Eurail (for those based outside Europe)](https://www.eurail.com/en/eurail-passes/global-pass)

[Interrail (for those based in Europe)](https://www.interrail.eu/en/interrail-passes/global-pass)
