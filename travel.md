# Travel

If you're planning on attending an event or visiting Politecnico di Milano, here are some travel options to consider.

#Travel Options
## Train
Taking the train to Milan is a great way to travel. Milan has excellent rail connections with the rest of Europe, and there are several high-speed trains that operate to and from Milan. From the main train station in Milan, Milano Centrale, you can take the subway (Line 2, green line) to reach Politecnico di Milano.
Apart from booking specific trains from A to B, you can also consider the option of a Interrail/Eurail pass. This gives great flexibility: you can use almost any train in Europe and most do not even need booking in advance.
There are now a range of options available. For example, there's a "4 days within one month pass" currently selling for under 200EUR. Those 4 days mean you can get to Milan from anywhere in Europe (max 2 days there, 2 days back).
 
Full pass options are listed here:

## Airplane
Milan is served by two main airports, Milano Malpensa (MPX), and Milano Linate (LIN); and by the nearby airport of Bergamo Orio al Serio (50km east of Milano). Malpensa is an intercontinental hub, while Linate mostly connects to European airports. Bergamo Orio al Serio mainly serves low-cost airlines to and from Europe and other continental destinations. Non-stop trains (2 rides per hour lasting 40-50 minutes) connect Malpensa with two main train stations in the City (Milano Centrale and Milano Cadorna). Linate is currently connected to the city center through an express bus, but by the end of 2022, a new metro line will be inaugurated, connecting the airport to the city center in 10 minutes.

## Car
Driving to Milan is not recommended due to traffic congestion and limited parking options. However, if you must drive, you can find parking options near Politecnico di Milano or use a car-sharing service.
